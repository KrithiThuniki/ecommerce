Overview of Issues and Solutions for Backend Improvement
1. Seller Dashboard
Issues:

Sellers couldn't effectively manage product listings or view real-time sales data.
Inconsistent data displayed in the dashboard, leading to confusion regarding order status and stock levels.
Solution:

Integrated a real-time update feature for product listings and order status using AJAX to enhance user experience.
Implemented a more robust database structure to ensure accurate product data and easy inventory management.
Added filters for better reporting and sales tracking.
2. Admin Panel
Issues:

Admins had difficulty managing customer queries, orders, and the verification process.
The system was slow due to inefficient database queries.
Lack of a detailed audit trail to track admin activities.
Solution:

Optimized SQL queries to speed up the admin panel and reduce loading times.
Implemented a detailed logging system to track admin activities for auditing purposes.
Introduced a comprehensive dashboard with search and filter functionalities for orders, customers, and product management.
3. Customer Buying Process
Issues:

The checkout process was overly complex and prone to errors.
Inconsistent customer data validation led to failed transactions.
Issues with payment gateway integration caused failed payments.
Solution:

Simplified the checkout process by reducing the number of required steps and adding a user-friendly UI.
Enhanced data validation mechanisms to ensure accurate customer and shipping information, reducing transaction errors.
Integrated a more reliable payment gateway API, ensuring smoother transactions and better handling of payment errors.
4. Backend Data Management (Address, Customer Data, Verification)
Issues:

Address storage had inconsistencies, with some users unable to save multiple shipping addresses.
Verification processes were incomplete, allowing unverified accounts to proceed with purchases.
Customer data storage was not optimized, leading to performance issues.
Solution:

Redesigned the address management system to allow multiple addresses per customer, implementing an address verification feature.
Improved the user verification process by adding email and phone number confirmation steps.
Refined the database schema for customer data to ensure better performance and optimized data retrieval.
Key Enhancements:
Database Optimization: We redesigned the database schema for better efficiency, reducing load times for large datasets (orders, customer info, product data).
Real-Time Updates: Introduced AJAX calls and WebSocket for real-time data fetching, reducing refresh dependencies.
User Experience: Improved the UI/UX for both customers and admins by simplifying navigation and providing more intuitive interfaces.
Security and Verification: Strengthened security measures with improved verification workflows for both customers and admins.
By focusing on these core areas, we addressed both functional and performance issues, improving the overall user experience for customers, sellers, and administrators.
